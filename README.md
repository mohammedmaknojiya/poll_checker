Create a database in xampp with a name 'poll'
import a database file which contains a table with a name 'poll_table'

Now start xampp server and run: "localhost/poll" in your browser.

project working:
if user had already responded then he/she will be not allwed.
If not voted before then we collect emailid and allow them to vote.
For checking that user had previously responded or not we maintain one database in which we store emailid of user.
